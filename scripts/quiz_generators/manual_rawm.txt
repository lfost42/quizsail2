1. Select the components in the three-tier hierarchical model. 
A. Core
B. Access
C. Distribution
D. Infrastructure
C., B., A.
--The distribution tier in the three-tier hierarchical model. 

2. In the three-tier hierarchical model, which tier connects end-user devices?
A. Core
B. Access
C. Distribution
B. 
--The distribution tier in the three-tier hierarchical model is responsible for providing connectivity between the access layer and the core layer. \n\nIt acts as an intermediary layer, facilitating communication between different access layer devices and forwarding traffic to the appropriate destination. The access tier focuses on connecting end-user devices, while the core tier handles high-speed backbone connectivity. The term "aggregation" is not typically used to describe a specific tier in this model. Therefore, the distribution tier is the correct choice in this context.

6. Which of the following types of traffic flows describes network traffic that is transiting between various servers in your datacenter?
A. West
B. South
C. East
D. North
A., C.
--When we have North-South traffic or communication, this refers to traffic that enters or leaves the data center from a system physically residing outside the datacenter. When we talk specifically about North traffic, this is traffic that is exiting the datacenter. Southbound traffic, on the other hand, is referring to traffic that is entering the data center. In both cases, the data is existing or entering the data center through a firewall or other network infrastructure boundary device, such as a router. East-West traffic or communication refers to data flow within a datacenter. For example, if we are using a spine and leaf architecture, any data flow between the various servers in the datacenter, even if it goes between different leaves, would be considered east-west traffic.
