3. Refer to the exhibit: <code>\n\n<flow name="routeEvents" >\n  <http:listener doc:name="HTTP: GET /" config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" path="/" />\n  <choice doc:name-"Choice" > \n    <when expression-"true" >\n      <logger level-"INFO" doc: name= '"Route1"' message="Route1"/>\n    </when>\n    <when expression-"true" >\n      <logger Level-"INFO" doc: name= '"Route2"' message="Route2"/>\n    </when>\n    <otherwise>\n      <logger level-"INFO" doc: name-*"Default"• message="Default™>\n    </otherwise>\n  </choice>\n</flow></code>
A. Route1
B. Route2
C. Route1,Route2
D. Route1,Route2,Default
Answer: A
Explanation: Only one of the routes in the Choice router executes, meaning that the first expression that evaluates to true triggers that route1 execution and the others are not checked. If none of the expressions are true, then the default route executes. Hence only Route1 will be executed as it is the first expression. hence output of logger is Route1.

4. In the execution of a Scatter-Gather, the flow1 route completes after 10 seconds and the flow2 route completes in 40 seconds. How many seconds does it take for the Scatter-Gather to complete?
A. 10
B. 50
C. 40
D. 20
Answer: C
Explanation: Scatter-Gather sends the event to each routes concurrently. Hence both route in this example will start in parallel. So total time to complete processing is 40 seconds 

5. A Utlility.dwl is located in a Mule project at src/main/resources/modules. The Utility.dwl file
defines a function named encryptString that encrypts a String What is the correct DataWeave to call
the encryptString function in a Transform Message component?
A. 1. %dw 2.0 2. output application/json 3. import modules::Utility 4. --- 5. Utility::encryptString( "John Smith" )
B. 1. %dw 2.0 2. output application/json 3. import modules::Utility 4. --- 5. encryptString( "John Smith" )
C. 1. %dw 2.0 2. output application/json 3. import modules.Utility 4. --- 5. encryptString( "John Smith" )
D. 1. %dw 2.0 2. output application/json 3. import modules.Utility 4. --- 5. Utility.encryptString( "John Smith" )
Answer: B
Explanation: The way you import a module impacts the way you need to call its functions from a DataWeave script. If the directive does not list specific functions to import or use * from to import all functions from a function module, you need to specify the module when you call the function from your script. For example, this import directive does not identify any functions to import from the String module, so it calls the pluralize function like this: Strings::pluralize("box").

6. A mule project contains MySQL database dependency . The project is exported from Anypoint Studio so that it can be deployed to Cloudhub. What export options needs to be selected to create the smallest deployable archive that will successfully deploy to Cloudhub?
A. Select both the options 1) Attach project sources 2) Include project module and dependencies
B. No need to select any of the below options 1) Attach project sources 2) Include project module and dependencies
C. Select only below option 2) Include project module and dependencies
D. Select only below option 1) Attach project sources
Answer: C
Explanation: You can choose Attach Project Sources to include metadata that Studio requires to reimport the deployable file as an open Mule project into your workspace. You must keep the Attach Project Sources option selected to be able to import the packaged JAR file back into a Studio workspace. But requirement here is to create smallest deployable archive that will successfully deploy to Cloudhub. Hence we can ignore this option. We need to select Include project module and dependencies As actual modules and external dependencies required to run the Mule application in a Mule runtime engine.

Answer: D
Explanation: Query parameters are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a url. They are extensions of the URL that are used to help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed. To append query params to the end of a URL, a '?' Is added followed immediately by a query parameter. To add multiple parameters, an '&' is added in between each.

8. There are three routes configured for Scatter-Gather and incoming event has a payload is an Array of three objects. How routing will take place in this scenario?
A. Incoming array objects would be split into three and each part would be sent to one route each in sequential manner
B. Incoming array objects would be split into three and each part would be sent to one route each in parallel
C. Entire event would be sent to each route sequentially
D. Entire event would be sent to each route in parallel
Answer: D
Explanation: Entire event would be sent to each route in parallel. Scatter-Gather works as follows : - The Scatter-Gather component receives a Mule event and sends a reference of this Mule event to each processing route. - Each of the processing routes starts executing in parallel. After all processors inside a route finish processing, the route returns a Mule event, which can be either the same Mule event without modifications or a new Mule event created by the processors in the route as a result of the modifications applied. - After all processing routes have finished execution, the Scatter-Gather component creates a new Mule event that combines all resulting Mule events from each route, and then passes the new Mule event to the next component in the flow.

A. Error - private flow
B. Error - main flow
C. Success - main flow
D. Validation Error
Answer: B
Explanation: Error in validation component will get processed by Processer level On Error Propagate block and then error will be rethrown which will get processed by flow level error handler which will set payload to "Error- main flow". Hence correct answer is Error - main flow 1) Request is received by HTTP listener 2) Try scope gets executed 3) The validator component in the Try scope creates an Error Object because the payload is not null. 4) The On Error Propagate handles the error. The payload is set to "Error - Try scope" 6) "Error - Try scope" is returned to the 'On Error Continue' block. Main flow execution stops. Payload is set to "Error - main flow" 7) "Error - main flow" is returned to the requestor in the body of the HTTP request. HTTP Status Code: 200

A. set the response Content-Type header to text/plain
B. set the response Content-Type header to application/json
C. set the request Content-Type header to application/json
D. set the request Content-Type header to text/plain
Answer: C
Explanation: The HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type client error response code indicates that the server refuses to accept the request because the payload format is in an unsupported format. The format problem might be due to the request's indicated Content-Type or Content-Encoding , or as a result of inspecting the data directly. In this case as per RAML specification data is expected in application/json and in request Content-Type is set as "text/plain" which is incorrect. Hence solution is set the request Content-Type header to application/json

51. What is the difference between a subflow and a sync flow?
A. No difference
B. Subflow has no error handling of its own and sync flow does
C. Sync flow has no error handling of its own and subflow does
D. Subflow is synchronous and sync flow is asynchronous
Answer: B
Explanation: A subflow processes messages synchronously (relative to the flow that triggered its execution) and always inherits both the processing strategy and exception strategy employed by the triggering flow. While a subflow is running, processing on the triggering flow pauses, then resumes only after the subflow completes its processing and hands the message back to the triggering flow. .

76. How are multiple conditions used in a Choice router to route events?
A. To route the same event to the matched route of EVERY true condition
B. To find the FIRST true condition, then distribute the event to the ONE matched route.
C. None of these
D. To find the FIRST true condition, then route the same event to the matched route and ALL FOLLOWING routes
Answer: B
Explanation: The Choice router dynamically routes messages through a flow according to a set of DataWeave expressions that evaluate message content. Each expression is associated with a different routing option. The effect is to add conditional processing to a flow, similar to an if/then/else code block in most programming languages. Only one of the routes in the Choice router executes, meaning that the first expression that evaluates to true triggers that route’s execution and the others are not checked. If none of the expressions are true, then the default route executes.

77. A flow needs to combine and return data from two different data sources. It contains a Database SELECT operation followed by an HTTP Request operation. What is the method to capture both payloads so the payload from the second request does not overwrite that from the first?
A. Put the Database SELECT operation inside a Cache scope
B. Put the Database SELECT operation inside a Message Enricher scope
C. Nothing, previous payloads are combined into the next payload
D. Save the payload from the Database SELECT operation to a variable
Answer: D
Explanation: Response from HTTP request will override the payload and hence response of database SELECT can be lost. Best way to preserve is to assign payload of first operation to variable using TransformMessage.

78. What is the correct syntax to add a customer ID as a URI parameter in an HTTP Listener's path attribute?

D. 1. {( trains: 2. 3. conductorIds map ((engId, index) -> 4. train: { 5. engineerId: engId 6. } 7. ) 8. )}
Answer: C
Explanation: * XML must have a root element. * XML only allows one root element * To avoid multiple root issues, you must create a root element for the XML output, whenever we transform output * When mapping array elements (JSON or JAVA) to XML, wrap the map operations in {(..)} -{ } are defining the object ( ) are transforming each element in the array as a key/value pair * The transformation to XML would fail if the above mentioned considerations were not taken into account. * Thus the transformation script declares a root element as trains and wraps the data in “{( )}“. Whenever you see such type of question, always look out for root element followed by {( )} wrapping map.

80. The main flow contains a Flow Reference for the child flow. What values are accessible in the child flow after a web client submits a request to http://localhost:8Q81/order? color=red?<code>\n\nListener HTTP: Get /order > Set Payload "Order01" > Set variable quantity to 1 > Flow Reference child</code>
A. payload
B. payload quantity var
C. payload color query param
D. payload quantity var color query param
Answer: D
Explanation: Flow Reference routes the Mule event to another flow or subflow, executes all processors in the referenced flow, and then routes the event back within the same Mule application.  When the main flow is triggered, the Mule event travels through and executes the flow until the event reaches the Flow Reference. The event then travels through and executes the referenced flow from beginning to end, and then returns to the main flow. This process enables you to treat the entire referenced flow like a single component in your current flow.

81. What Database expression transforms the input to the output?<code>\n\n<?xml version="1.0" encoding= "UTF-8"?>\n<order>\n  <item orderId- "592">\n    <shipping>international</shipping>\n    <item>T-shirt Navy</item>\n    <size>L</size>\n    <quantity>1</quantity>\n    <price>20</price>\n  <item orderId-"972">\n    <shipping>domestic</shipping>\n    <item>Cargo Shorts</item>\n    <size>XL</size>\n    <quantity>2</quantity>\n    <price>30</price>\n  </item>\n</order>\n\n\nPayload output:\n[\n  {\n    "index": 0,\n    "orderId": "592",\n    "itemName": "T-shirt Navy",\n    "lineltemPrice": 20\n  },\n  {\n    "index": 1,\n    "orderId": "972",\n    "itemName": "Cargo Shorts",\n    "lineltemPrice": 60\n  }\n]</code>
A. payload.order.*item map( (value, index) -> { index: index, orderId: value.orderId, itemName: value.item, lineItemPrice: (value.price as :number) * (value quantity as :number) })

A. After
B. null
C. Before
D. Validation error
Answer: D
Explanation: 1) Payload is successfully set to “Before” 2) Is null validation is used which will pass the message only if payload is null. In this case as payload is not null, it creates an Error Object. Flow execution stops #[error.description] = “Validation error” 3) Because no error handler is defined, the Mule default error handler handles the error 4) “Validation error” is the error message returned to the requestor in the body of the HTTP request with HTTP Status Code: 500
