# QuizSail 2.0
Test Prep Engine, forked from [jmatzen](https://github.com/jmatzen/quizsail). 

I started to need additional functionality as I started to utilize this for other certificaiton exams, most notably CompTIA. I needed a way to scrape questions from a book and create quizzes out of them, especially when the questions and answers were on different pages. 

#### QuizSail is a test prep engine
The test prep engine uses a technique called *assumed competency*.  This technique assumes that if you answer the question correctly the first time that you already know the answer. Because of this, it's running on sort of an honor system, so if the user is not sure what the answer is they should not enter any answer at all instead of guessing.

QuizSail's competency system works by holding a certain number of questions from the pool in-flight.  Once the user has correctly answered a question in the in-flight state so many times in a row, the question is moved to the completed state and is not asked again.  As long as the in-flight pool is full, the next question to appear is randomly selected from the questions in the pool that aged the most so that the same question is not likely to be asked twice in a row.

## List of updates for QuizSail 2.0

#### Refresh Quiz
🔥 Log functionality that keeps track of all successful first attempts for the last 10 sessions.  
🔥 Option to prune logs once there are 5 in case there are sessions that were deleted prior to starting a new one.  
🔥 Option to refresh a quiz after 5 sessions: removes the questions that were answered correctly on the first try at least 3 out of the last 5 sessions. Original quiz is moved to the "retired" directory.  

#### Refresh Quiz (in progress)
✅ Scroll through all questions, answers and explanations.   
🔲 Add or modify explanations.  
🔲 Modify Answers.  
🔲 Modify question.  
🔲 Modify Choice.  

#### Navigation and Features
☑️ [Delete All Sessions] option added to Start.  
☑️ [Return to Start] link added to quiz page.  
☑️ Sessions deleted upon completion.  
☑️ New quizzes are dynamically added to start menu (add json files to the public/quizzes folder).   
☑️ Avoids giving the same question twice in a row (mostly) unless it's the last question.  
☑️ Explanations added to the result if available (need to populate the "e" item in the json file). 

#### Formatting quiz text flexibility
⚙️ Able to parse line breaks using \n.  
⚙️ Text font switches to monotype when wrapped in < code > tags.  

#### Other Helper Scripts
📃 [codify.py](scripts/quiz_generators/) takes input text, wraps it in < code > tags, adds line breaks, and outputs it into a single line to past back into a quiz json file.  
📃 [dion_quiz.py](scripts/quiz_generators/) to convert the results of a Jason Dion practice test (from Udemy) into a quizsail json file.  
📃 [Sybex Scripts](scripts/quiz_generators) to convert Sybex practice tests (1 file for questions/choices and 1 file for the answers/explanations) into a quizsail json file.  
📃 [Script](scripts/explanation_adder/) to add an json explanation item to any working json file (this is a placeholder, you'll need to fill in the explanations).
