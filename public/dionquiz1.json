This means there are only 1000 possible combinations for each of the 4-digit numbers. Due to this small key space, it is rather quick to brute force the pin and crack the WPS security. A brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting every possible combination for a password or pin until they crack it. Password spraying is an attack that attempts to access a large number of accounts (usernames) with a few commonly used passwords. A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer, network, or other IT resource by systematically entering every word in a dictionary or list file.

Crosstalk can occur if the twisted pairs are not twisted sufficiently, because the twisting of the cable pairs reduces crosstalk between neighboring cable pairs. The twisting is done to help cancel exterior electromagnetic interference. To solve this cable's crosstalk issue, the cable pairs should be trimmed down and the cable re-terminated again properly. The EIA/TIA-568A and EIA/TIA-568B wiring standards utilize different colored cable pairs on each end of a cable. If you use a mismatch of the two standards on the same cable, it would create a cable that cannot be used as a straight-through or patch cable. This would not lead to intermittent connectivity, though, it would lead to a scenario with no connectivity. The transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) reversed is a common issue with fiber optic patch cables. A split pair error occurs when one wire from each of two different pairs gets swapped identically on both ends of the cable.

Traffic should be properly tagged when combined over a single trunk port to ensure they are not sent to the wrong VLAN by mistake. If VLAN tagging is not enabled, all of the VLAN traffic will be sent to the native or default VLAN, VLAN 1. By default, VLAN 1 is enabled and all unused ports are assigned to it. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast storms that result from them. STP is defined in the IEEE 802.1d standard. Power over Ethernet (POE) is a technology that lets network cables carry electrical power. POE is defined in the IEEE 802.1af. The IEEE 802.1x standard is a network authentication protocol that opens ports for network access when an organization authenticates a user's identity and authorizes them for access to the network. The user's identity is determined based on their credentials or certificate, which is confirmed by the RADIUS server."

A private IP address is an IP address reserved for internal use behind a router or other Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, apart from the public. Private IP addresses provide an entirely separate set of addresses that still allow access to a network without taking up a public IP address space. Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a feature in operating systems (such as Windows) that enables computers to automatically self-configure an IP address and subnet mask when their DHCP server isn't reachable. Classless IP addressing solutions allow for the use of subnets that are smaller than the classful subnets associated with Class A, Class B, or Class C networks."

The last ACL on the firewall should be set to DENY ANY ANY, as this is a form of implicit deny and considered a best practice in network security. A brute force password attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. If a brute force password attack was used, there would be numerous failed login attempts showing in the security log files on the servers. TACACS+ and RADIUS misconfigurations would lead to authentication issues, not to log erasures."

The tracert command is used on Windows devices to show details about the path that a packet takes from a host to a target and displays information about each hop in the path. The arp command is used to view and modify the local address resolution protocol (ARP) cache of a device, which contains recently resolved MAC addresses of IP hosts on the network. The route command is used to create, view, or modify manual entries in the network routing tables of a computer or server."
